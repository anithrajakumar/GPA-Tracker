# GPA-Tracker
Project designed to keep track of GPA throughout the years of my study, with multiple version

Verison 1 (GPA_Tracker):
This version was used to account for one course at a time, and was mainly console based. The data was not saved at the end of the program,
however an organzied list was printed out to be copied and paste into a notes app. This version lack a lot of usability, however it was 
still used to track my GPA.

Version 2 (GPA_Tracker_JavaFX) [**Work in progess**]:
This version introduced a lot more different things, and added a visual component to the application. This version saved the data through the use
of the app and was able to account for all semesters, courses, and even assessments. Being able to add a theory/lab component to each assessment, to 
be able to add assessments within course and being able to add courses within semesters. This approach, used a design pattern called "state desgin
pattern" where each state was a different screen of the app.

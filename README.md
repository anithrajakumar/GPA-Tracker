# GPA-Tracker
Project designed to keep track of GPA throughout the years of my study, with multiple version

Verison 1 (GPA_Tracker):
This version was used to account for one course at a time, and was mainly console based. The data was not saved at the end of the program,
however an organzied list was printed out to be copied and paste into a notes app. This version lack a lot of usability, however it was 
stilled used to track my GPA.
